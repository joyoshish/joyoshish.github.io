Hey there — welcome to my little corner of the internet. This space is part portfolio, part notebook, and part late-night side project hub. I use it to share what I’m working on, what I’m learning, and sometimes just what I’m thinking out loud.

I currently work as a Risk Analyst at American Express. In my current role, I design and develop Key Risk Indicators (KRIs) and data-driven risk models to automate and enhance risk control mechanisms. By applying machine learning, statistical analysis, and end-to-end data pipelines, I help ensure scalable, efficient, and proactive risk management. I hold a B.Tech. in Information Technology from IIEST Shibpur and an M.Tech. in Computer Science (Specialization in Data Science) from ISI Kolkata.

You’ll find many of my blog posts here exploring topics in data science, machine learning, and computer science — written with both clarity and curiosity in mind. If you're a fellow learner, a data nerd, or someone just starting out in this field, I hope you find something useful or thought-provoking here.

In my free time, I’m usually doing things that help me slow down a bit, like experimenting in the kitchen (often with no recipe), rewatching a comfort web series (read The Big Bang Theory), or getting completely absorbed in a good non-fiction or documentary.

Thanks for stopping by — feel free to explore, learn, or just say hello.
